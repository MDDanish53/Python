function is a block of code which performs a specific task 

Advantages : 

1. functions are reusable - function can be reused again and again 
2. modularity - complex process of project can be divided into small functions
3. scoping - a varaible created outside a function is not accessible inside a function
4. maintainability - if a function has an issue, we can replace or change it without changing the entire code 

Disadvantages :

1. if a function is not designed properly then it consumes memory and time due to which our program speed reduces 
2. if our program code is not maintained properly then it is difficult to maintain it.

function name should be meaningful
length of function should be small
avoid global varaibles and rely on parameters

global variables - varaibles which are defined outside the function, these varaibles can be used through out the program as well as inside the function 

local varaibles - varaibles which are defined and used only inside a particular function, local varaibles are accessible only inside the function
