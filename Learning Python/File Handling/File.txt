file is a collection of stored data, we can access file, modify it, and can save it permanently.

we can store text, images, videos and other types of data in file.

If we are working with a file in python we can :

read file
write file 
append file - add data at the end of existing data in the file 
modify file

in python if we want to work with file then we can work with two primary file types :

1. text file (.txt, .csv) - we can read its data as a human being
2. binary files (non-text data, .png, .jpg, .pdf, .mp3) - we cannot read its data as a human being

_______________________________________________________

if we want to work with a file then we have to open it first

with statement : 

as we have to close the file after opening it, so instead of writing close function again and again, we use with statement

with statement closes our file automatically after using it prevents file corruption. 

syntax - with open('file_path', 'mode') as var_name(file_name):
    print(var_name.read()) //reading the file

we are not using close function as with statement automatically closes the file after using it
