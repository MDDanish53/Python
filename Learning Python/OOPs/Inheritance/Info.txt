Inheritance - properties of parent class can be used in its child class without writing the property in child class, it reduces code duplication
using inheritance we can reuse code and extend the existing code.

if we want to use properties of a class in another class then we have to pass the class name(whose property we want to use) in the class where we want to use the properties:

ex - 
class parent():
    p1
    p2

class child(parent):
    p3
    p4

in child class we can access and use the p1, and p2 of parent class
