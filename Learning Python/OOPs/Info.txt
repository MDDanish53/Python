before OOPs developers used Structured/procedural programming 

Structured programming - data execute step by step in functions 

problems faced in structured programming :

1. Code Duplication
2. Code Maintenance
3. Data Security Issues (Modifying any part of program is critical)
4. Poor Code Reusability
5. No Real World Representation 

Concepts in OOPS :

1. Classes and Objects
2. Inheritance
3. Encapsulation
4. Abstraction
5. Polymorphism
