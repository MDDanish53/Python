our program runs from top to bottom
we apply two conditions to calculate area of given radius
if radius value is float then only calculate its area 
if its other data type value then dont calculate the area
for this we use control statements
it consists of :
1. conditonals - if, elif, else
2. loops - for, while, else, suite, nested, infinite
3. statements - pass, continue, break, assert, return
